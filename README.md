# Abstract

Data makes science possible. Sharing data improves visibility, and makes the research process transparent. This increases trust in the work, and allows for independent reproduction of results. However, a large proportion of data from published research is often only available to the original authors. Despite the obvious benefits of sharing data, and scientists' advocating for the importance of sharing data, most advice on sharing data discusses its broader benefits, rather than the practical considerations of sharing. This paper provides practical, actionable advice on how to actually share data alongside research. The key message is sharing data falls on a continuum, and entering it should come with minimal barriers.

# Take home messages 

- You don't have to do every single thing to publish your data
- Take small steps - get the data somewhere first, add more detail as you go
- Try and get a DOI from a service like Zenodo or Dryad

# Bio

Dr. Nicholas Tierney (PhD. Statistics, BPsySci (Honours)) is a Lecturer in Business Analytics and Statistics at Monash University, working with Professors
[Dianne Cook](http://dicook.org/) and [Rob Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/). His research aims to improve data analysis
workflow, and make data analysis more accessible. Crucial to this work is producing high quality software to
accompany each research idea. Mostly recently, Nick's work is focussing on exploring longitudinal data ([brolgar](http://brolgar.njtierney.com/)), and improving how we share data alongside research ( [ddd](https://github.com/karthik/ddd)). Other work has focussed on exploring data
with the R package [visdat](http://visdat.njtierney.com/), and on creating analysis principles and tools
to simplify working with, exploring, and modelling missing data with the
package [naniar](http://naniar.njtierney.com/). Nick has experience working with decision trees ([treezy](http://treezy.njtierney.com/)),
optimisation ([maxcovr](http://maxcovr.njtierney.com/)), Bayesian Data Analysis, and MCMC diagnostics ([mmcc](http://mmcc.njtierney.com/).

Nick is a member of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) collective, which works to make science
open using R, has been the lead organiser for the rOpenSci ozunconf
events from 2016-2018 ([2016](https://auunconf.ropensci.org/), [2017](https://ozunconf17.ropensci.org/), [2018](https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/)), and co-hosts the rstats podcast ["Credibly
Curious"](https://soundcloud.com/crediblycurious) with [Dr. Saskia Freytag](https://careers.amsi.org.au/saskia/). Outside of research, Nick likes to
hike, rockclimb, make coffee, bake sourdough, (eventually) knit a hat, take photos, and explore new hobbies.
